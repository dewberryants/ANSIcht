# ANSIcht

(A play on the words ANSI and "Ansicht",
the german word for "point of view" or "perspective".)

ANSIcht is a simple text art editor that supports
24bit colors and unicode text. Right now, the feature
set is very limited to a basic, on-the-fly calculated
color palette and pre-defined text characters, as
well as single pixel drawing.

This was developed for a personal game project, and
I'm happy to share it with everybody!

Currently, ANSIcht exports and reads from .txt files
containing characters and ANSI escape sequences.

Many thanks go out to the developers of pygame,
which ANSIcht is mostly developed in.

Happy painting!
