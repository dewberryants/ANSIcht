# ANSIcht

(A pun on ANSI and "Ansicht", the german word for "point of view" or "perspective".)

A simple ANSI art editor, featuring 24-bit RGB colors and extended ASCII symbol tables.

This was developed for a personal game project and I'm happy to share this, in case you want to do something similar.

Currently, exports and reads from .txt files containing characters and ANSI escape sequences.
